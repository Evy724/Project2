## Usage

The user creates an account with their name, username, email, and a custom password that they will use to log in every time they load the app. After log in, the user will be greeted with an updated list of all toys that others have posted and may browse for toys at their leisure. Through the bottom navigation bar, the post button allows the user to see their current inventory of toys, as well as a button to create a new post. Once the user has posted their own toy(s), they may browse and choose a toy to initiate and then finalize a trade. Finally the Profile button will lead the user to their Profile page where they are able to see all posts they have made, as well as their custom profile statistics and a list of anonymous reviews that others have left for them.
